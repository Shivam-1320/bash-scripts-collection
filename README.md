AutoWebDeploy is a beginner-friendly Bash script that automates the deployment of web applications from a GitHub repository to a Linux server using Apache or NGINX.

It’s built for personal projects, testing environments, and those learning Bash automation.
Just provide your GitHub repo — AutoWebDeploy handles the rest.

**🚀 Features**

✅ Color-coded CLI output for an improved user experience

✅ Auto-install Apache or NGINX (based on your choice)

✅ Clean and prepare the target directory before deployment

✅ Clone any GitHub repository to your web directory

✅ Automatically set correct permissions for web access

✅ Restart the web server after deployment
